Reservoir Engineering with Python

The Klinkenberg Effect
1. k(g) = k(I) + c(/pm)
   kg= measured gas permeability pm = Mean pressure kL= equivalent liquid permeability, i.e. absolute permeability, kc = slope of line.
2. c = b.k(I) = 6.9 kL^(-0.36)
3. 6.9kL^(0.64) + pmkL - pm*kg

   Equation 3 can be used to calculate the absoulute permeability when only one gas permeability measurement of a core sample is made at pm.
